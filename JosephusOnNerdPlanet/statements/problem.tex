\newpage

We already knew Josephus's problem: n people standing in a circle waiting to be killed. Start from a person, countdown from m to 0 and that man is killed. The last man is the lucky because he is the only person is given up.\newline\newline
But Nerd on the Nerd planet think it too easy so they add a parameter:\newline
The countdown don't begin from m but begin from m + (i mod k) with i is the position of a people and k is a given number.
